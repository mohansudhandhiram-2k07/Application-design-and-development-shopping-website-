💻 TechStore - Laptop Comparator
TechStore is a simple, static website built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript that allows users to compare the specifications of different laptops side-by-side.

All laptop data is hardcoded directly into the compare.html file. The site provides a clean interface to select two devices and view their CPU, RAM, storage, and price in a simple table.

✨ Features
Homepage: A simple landing page (index.html) to welcome the user.

Comparison Page: A dedicated page (compare.html) where users can select two laptops from dropdown menus.

Dynamic Results: Clicking "Compare" instantly generates a table showing the specs for both laptops.

About Page: A page (about.html) describing the project's purpose.

Styling: Cleanly styled using the Tailwind CSS framework.
